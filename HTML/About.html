                            Hello, I'm Ridwan, From Team Baik App. 
                            I am in class 13 of SMKN 1 Cimahi, majoring in Power
                            Communication Electronics Engineering. 
                            <span> I became interested in Electrical Engineering when I was in junior high school. </span> When I
                            started studying at SMKN 1 Cimahi, I became interested in many
                            things besides electricity, one of which was organization. 
                            I started following <span> the student council.</span> In addition to
                            participating in the organization, I am also active in various
                            extracurricular activities ranging from <span> the English Club,
                            Nihongo Kurabu, to the Marching Band extracurricular. </span> It's not
                            easy to arrange a schedule, especially in addition to
                            participating in organizations at school, I also participate
                            outside of school, namely the Cimahi Student Council and Student
                            Council Forum as well as the West Java Student Council Forum.
                            I'm currently participating in <span>the Samsung Innovation Campus
                            bootcamp program, </span> I really enjoy all of it. Apart from being a
                            new thing for me, I also get a lot of knowledge from cool
                            mentors
                        </p>
